    <mark style="background-color:magenta">I’m going to regret this. I’m driving my parents’ car. The one I hate. I want you to know that I’m going to get a job and money. Goodbye. I want to focus on my major now. I want to be part of the real world now. It was always loveless. It has been a chore for many years.</mark>

 I feel like there’s no time to explain. I don’t know. I don’t know.

  Oh the pineapple it said to me. It told me to buy something else. Oh it told me to buy the strawberries. Oh why I asked the pineapple. The pineapple shook its head and said I don’t know. I said fine I’ll buy the strawberries. I took my wallet and a package of strawberries to the cashier. Here I said. I want to purchase the strawberries I said. The cashier looked at me and said ok. You can purchase the strawberries the cashier said. I can complete the transaction for you the cashier said. The cashier took the strawberries and my wallet.
